1) The runbook supports only resource manager virtual machines, support of classic VMs is deprecated in this version.
2) The runbook authenticates to Azure as a Service Principal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli See "AsureConnectionName" parameter description.
3) The name or ID of Azure subscription in which the resources will be created. By default, the
   runbook will use the value defined in the Variable setting named "Default Azure Subscription"
4) The name of the Automation connection asset with type of "AzureServicePrincipal"
  that contains the information required to connect to resources
     in target Azure subscription as a Service Principal defined in "Azure Run As Account".
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-connections
        Azure Run As Account can be created in different ways:
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-quickstart-create-account
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#create-a-run-as-account-in-the-portal
5) (gah too much formatting) (time to be inconsisten)

        By default, the runbook will use the value defined in the Variable setting named "Default AzureRunAsConnection".
        Check if connection with name "AzureRunAsConnection" with type "AzureServicePrincipal" already exists in Automation Account in Shared Resources\Connections
        If no, create "Azure Run As Account" as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#create-a-run-as-account-in-the-portal 
        Connection "AzureRunAsConnection" should have been created automatically during creation "Azure Run As Account".

    .PARAMETER Simulate
        If $true, the runbook will not perform any power actions and will only simulate evaluating the tagged schedules. Use this
        to test your runbook to see what it will do when run normally (Simulate = $false).

    .EXAMPLE
        For testing examples, see the documentation at:

        https://automys.com/library/asset/scheduled-virtual-machine-shutdown-startup-microsoft-azure
    
    .INPUTS
        None.

    .OUTPUTS
        Human-readable informational and error messages produced during the job. Not intended to be consumed by another runbook.
